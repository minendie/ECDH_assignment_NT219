This is a small assignment that I did in the 3rd semester at UIT for NT219-cryptography class. <br />
Steps of algorithm: <br />
  • Step1: Initalize system params <br />
  • Step2: Each party self-generate a pair of private and public key, respectively <br />
  • Step3: Send public key to each other <br />
  • Step4: Calculate shared-key by self-privatekey and partner's public key. <br />
So, we can exchange messages encrypted by shared key for confidentiality. <br />
