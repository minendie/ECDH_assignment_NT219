This is a small assignment that I did in the 3rd semester at UIT for NT219-cryptography class. 
Steps of algorithm:
  • Step1: Initalize system params
  • Step2: Each party self-generate a pair of private and public key, respectively
  • Step3: Send public key to each other
  • Step4: Calculate shared-key by self-privatekey and partner's public key.
So, we can exchange messages encrypted by shared key for confidentiality.
